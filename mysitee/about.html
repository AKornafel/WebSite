    		&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Abigail Kornafel and I am currently a senior at New York University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in web design/web development. I grew up in Los Angeles, California but decided that I wanted to be on the east coast for college. While most of my time is dedicated towards school, my internship, and tutoring, in my free time you can find me on walks with my puppy Merry, doing hot yoga in the West Village, hanging out with friends, or at home watching YouTube videos (I currently am into watching videos on finance and savings advice).     
    		<br>
    		&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy fascination with code began in my senior year of high school. I had enrolled in the only programming class offered at the time, in which we were taught Java. What drew me to the subject was the transformation that occurred when creating a project. Code could look like gibberish, but when compiled and run it became functional system, graphic, or website and the creative side of me was fascinated by this. 
    		<br> 
    		&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI also developed an interest in different fields in business, as reflected in my internships. I have always enjoyed working with others, whether it be through tutoring or my business development internships. I've explored marketing and management and would love to be involved in one of these fields in the future as well.
